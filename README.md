# Project: Text Editor

# This program is an implementation of a basic text editor. When first opened, it will read from a text file (txt3.txt) and write the data that was read to the screen. The user can then edit the text in the editor as desired. When the user quits the editor by pressing ESC, all changes to the text are saved in the file. 

# This project was written using 16 bit x86 assembly language. It is MASM/TASM compatible and fits a 80x25 screen size.
